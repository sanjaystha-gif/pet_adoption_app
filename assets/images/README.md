This folder should contain the images used by the app UI.

Expected image filenames (place the files here):

- `main_logo.png`    → app logo (already present)
- `profile.jpg`      → profile avatar shown in header
- `shephard.jpg`     → pet image for "Shephard"
- `kaali.jpg`        → pet image for "Kaali"
- `khaire.jpg`       → pet image for "Khaire"
- `gori.jpg`         → pet image for "Gori"

Notes:
- The app falls back to `main_logo.png` when a named image is missing, so you can add images later without crashing the app.
- Add square or rectangular images at reasonable resolution (e.g., 800×800 or 1200×800) for better display.
